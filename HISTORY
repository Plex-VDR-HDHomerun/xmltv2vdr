xmltv2vdr Revision History
--------------------------

2003-04-04: Version 1.0

- Initial revision.

2003-04-05: Version 1.0.1

- Clear EPG information before putting in the new info. This stops duplicate
events showing in the EPG when times are changed for programmes

2003-04-07: Version 1.0.2

- Problem with ending an event when "no info available" is now fixed
- Problem with 2 "e" event end codes at end of EPG crashing VDR is now fixed

2003-05-01: Version 1.0.3

- Problem with not reading final data and closing the SOCK sometimes crashes
  VDR - now fixed.
- Problem with inserting channel information when the NID > 0 is now fixed,
  thanks to Gerhard Steiner.

2003-05-18: Version 1.0.4

- Problem with options fixed
- Changes incorporated from Erik Günther ("I did find out that VDR ignores extra  information on a line so adding xmltv-info at the end of the line works fine.   The problem was that xmltv2vdr.pl expected that all lines in input ether 
  to have a xmltv extention or was not an header line.  I also added an new 
  option -t for changing the timeout. This was for my machine a P3 600 
  was to slow and wasn't done in time. So now I can specify -t 600 for 600s)
- Fixed problems with the "expected SVDRP code 250, but received 451 at 
  ./xmltv2vdr.pl line 56" error.
- Added extra flag, -v to show warning/debug messages

2003-05-19: Version 1.0.5

- Added simulation mode option (-s) for debugging. This does not send info
  to SVDRP, but prints all commands it would sent to stdout.
- Fixed problem for satellite users not getting information into VDR. Problem
  was that the frequency is not chopped to three digits like terrestrial.

2004-04-19: Version 1.0.6

- Added fixes for German and English HTML translations (&amp etc)
- Some people report having time problems, I suspect this is due to incorrect
  time zone settings or problems with xmltv listings, but I have added
  a skew setting to xmltv2vdr (e.g. -a -60 to set the listings data back one 
  hour).
- Tidied up the usage information
- Fixed SVDRReceive which caused broken pipe errors, and ignoring last channel
  in the config file
- Fixed small problem with pattern matching code (thanks to Dominic Morris 
  and Tony Leino)

2007-04-13: Version 1.0.7

- Code updates and speed improvements, with thanks to Sebastien Lucas

2010-03-07: Version 1.0.8
